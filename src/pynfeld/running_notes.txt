1. install pipenv

pip install --user pipenv
the result is like :
pipenv, version 2022.11.5 (today's date), looks like they release it every day. 

I have switched to conda environment

2. pip freeze > requirements.txt
conda env export > environment.yml

3. make a virtual environment
pip install virtualenv 
virtualenv venv | conda create -n venv
source venv/bin/activate | conda activate venv
deactivate | conda deactivate

4. The app runs from base.py but not from pynfeld.py
Right now i can add list 
next connect css to the html - now the css is also connected.

The app now runs even from pynfeld, However I had to remove if __name__ = "__main__" 
added css also and it is rendering it perfectly

5. Add some documentation. Next add heading
element, paragraph and image parser.

6. Now I can add table, paragraphs with heading. Next, I have to try to add
paragraph with images by defining a type of dictionary.
