1. First create a virtual environment: 
Option 1: Use pip and install pipenv
command::pip install --user pipenv
Result::pipenv, version 2022.11.5 (today's date), looks like they release it every day. 
Update::I have switched to conda environment

2. Regularly use the requirements and yml file to save what packages have been used in this
command::pip freeze > requirements.txt or 
command::conda env export > environment.yml

3. Make a virtual environment
command::pip install virtualenv 

4. Create the virtual envionrment
command::virtualenv venv | conda create -n venv

5. Activate the virtual environment
command::source venv/bin/activate | conda activate venv
command::deactivate | conda deactivate

6. Note: The app right now runs from pynfeld.py
command:: python3 pynfeld.py

The app now runs even from pynfeld, However I had to remove if __name__ = "__main__" 
added css also and it is rendering it perfectly

5. Add some documentation. Next add heading
element, paragraph and image parser.

6. Now I can add table, paragraphs with heading. Next, I have to try to add
paragraph with images by defining a type of dictionary. I can do that too now

7. Try to add footer sections now.
Deadline: 11/28/2022.
